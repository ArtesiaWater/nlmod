    "In nlmod we use a specific caching method called [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). The memoization is implemented in the `nlmod` caching module. The `cache_netcdf` decorator function handles most of the magic for caching netcdf files. When the cache is created all function arguments are stored in a dictionary and saved (pickled) as a .pklz file. The check on function arguments (step 2A) is done by reading the pickle and comparing the output with the arguments of the current function call.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Properties\n",
    "1. All function arguments are pickled and saved together with the netcdf file. If the function arguments use a lot of memory this process can be become slow. This should be taken into account when you decide to use caching.\n",
    "2. Function arguments that cannot be pickled using the `pickle` module raise an error in the caching process.\n",
    "3. A function with mutable function arguments that are modified during function execution should not be used in caching. It can be used but the cache will never be used. The check on function arguments will always be False since the original function arguments are compared with the modified function argument.\n",
    "4. If one of the function arguments is an xarray Dataset we only check if the dataset has the same dimensions and coordinates as the cached netcdf file. There is no check on the variables (DataArrays) in the dataset because it would simply take too much time to check all the variables in the dataset. Also, most of the time it is not necesary to check all the variables as they are not used to create the cached file. There is one example where a variable from the dataset is used to create the cached file. The `nlmod.read.jarkus.get_bathymetry` uses the 'Northsea' DataArray to create a bathymetry dataset. When we access the 'Northsea' DataArray using `ds['Northsea']` in the `get_bathymetry` function there would be no check if the 'Northsea' DataArray that was used to create the cache is the same as the 'Northsea' DataArray in the current function call. The current solution for this is to make the 'Northsea' DataArray a separate function argument in the `get_bathymetry` function. This makes it also more clear which data is used in the function.\n",
    "5. There is a check to see if the module where the function is defined has been changed since the cache was created. This helps not to use the cache when changes are made to the function. Unfortunately when the function uses other functions from different modules these other modules are not checked for recent changes.\n",
    "6. The `cache_netcdf` decorator uses `functools.wraps` and some home made magic to add properties, such as the name and the docstring, of the original function to the decorated function. This assumes that the original function has a docstring with a \"Returns\" heading. If this is not the case the docstring is not modified."

    "#### storing cache on disk\n",
    "\n",
    "Many memoization methods use a hash of the function arguments as the filename. Thus creating multiple files for different function calls. The memoization in `nlmod` uses a user-defined filename (`cachename`) to store the cache. If the function is called with different arguments the previous cached file is overwritten. By not creating a new file for every unique set of function arguments we reduce the number of files and therefore the memory size on the disk. By saving the function output as netCDF file it is also possible to read the file seperately from the caching process. While this is not something you would often do it can help when debugging. "
